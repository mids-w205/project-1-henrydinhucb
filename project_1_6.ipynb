    "# 1.6 Ideas on how the sales data can be used to help identify best customers\n",
    "\n",
    "The data science team would like to know your best ideas on how the sales data can be used to help identify the company's best customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "They are going to start with the most common and most basic model known as RFM, which consists of the 3 dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* R - Recency - How recently did the customer purchase?\n",
    "\n",
    "* F - Frequency - How often do they purchase?\n",
    "\n",

    "At first glance, it's pretty easy to think of a simple query for each dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, after some thought, it's not quite so easy. It's very open ended, with a lot of grey areas, and no single right or wrong answer (just like 99% of data science and AI!)  For each dimension, there can be some pretty complex ways to determine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data science team also has to come up with a way to synthesize the 3 dimensions into a single customer value for each customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "The data science team would like for you to present your ideas in the form of a title and 4 paragraphs as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Title - A title describing what you will be explaining\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recency - A brief paragraph explaining your ideas on how the data can be used to determine recency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Frequency - A brief paragraph explaining your ideas on how the data can be used to determine frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Monetary Value - A brief paragraph explaining your ideas on how the data can be used to determine monetary value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Synthesis - A brief paragraph explaining your ideas on how to synthesize the 3 dimensions of recency, frequency, and monetary value into a customer value for each customer and how to determine who the best customers are.\n",

    "Title: Comprehensive Analysis for Identifying Best Customers Using the RFM Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Recency: To gauge recency, we calculate the time elapsed since each customer's last purchase. This data is available in the \n",
    "    'expected_visits_per_week' column, representing the average monthly store visits by a customer. \n",
    "    Customers with more recent purchases receive higher recency scores. By utilizing quantiles or percentile rankings, \n",
    "    we can categorize customers into recency segments like \"recent,\" \"moderate,\" and \"inactive,\" based on their recency score. \n",
    "    This approach aids in identifying actively engaged customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequency: Frequency is determined by counting the number of purchases made by each customer within a specific timeframe, \n",
    "    such as a month or year. This information is accessible in the 'total_purchases' column, which records the number of \n",
    "    monthly purchases per customer. Additionally, we track a customer's most frequently purchased product in the \n",
    "    'most_purchased_product' column. Frequent purchasers are assigned higher frequency scores. Similar to recency, \n",
    "    we can segment customers based on their frequency scores, with high-frequency customers representing loyalty and \n",
    "    low-frequency customers indicating the need for targeted marketing efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monetary Value: Monetary value assesses how much a customer spends at the store. We calculate this by summing the total \n",
    "    purchase amounts for each customer, which can be found in the 'total_purchase_value' column. Furthermore, we have data\n",
    "    in the 'expected_spending_per_week' and 'expected_spending_per_month' columns, showing a customer's average weekly and\n",
    "    monthly spending. Customers with higher total or average spending receive higher monetary value scores. Like recency \n",
    "    and frequency, we can segment customers based on their monetary value, with high monetary value customers significantly \n",
    "    contributing to store revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Synthesis: To consolidate the three dimensions of RFM analysis into a single customer value, we can assign weights based on \n",
    "    their relative importance to business goals. For instance, if retaining high-value customers is our top priority, we can \n",
    "    assign higher weights to monetary value. We then calculate the overall RFM score for each customer by combining their \n",
    "    recency, frequency, and monetary value scores, weighted accordingly. The customers with the highest RFM scores are \n",
    "    considered the best customers, exhibiting recent activity, frequent engagement, and significant spending. Analyzing these \n",
    "    top-scoring customers allows for tailored marketing strategies, loyalty programs, and personalized recommendations to \n",
    "    enhance their relationship and maximize their lifetime value.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the provided data yields valuable insights into customer behavior and purchasing patterns, certain questions or \n",
    "analyses may prove challenging or impossible due to data limitations. Here are some questions that are difficult to address\n",
    "with the available data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Customer Demographics: The data primarily focuses on sales transactions and customer interactions, lacking information \n",
    "    on customer demographics (e.g., age, gender, location, occupation), which is essential for understanding customer segments \n",
    "    and targeted marketing campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Customer Satisfaction: Assessing customer satisfaction requires data beyond transactional records, such as customer feedback,\n",
    "    reviews, or surveys.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Market Trends and External Factors: The data does not include information about external factors like economic conditions, \n",
    "    competitor actions, or industry trends, making it impossible to gauge their impact on customer behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Customer Engagement Channels: The data does not capture how customers interact with the store \n",
    "    (e.g., online, in-store, mobile app) and which channels are most effective for different customer segments, \n",
    "    valuable insights for marketing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Seasonal Effects and Events: Specific events or seasonal trends that influence sales and customer behavior are not covered \n",
    "    in the data. Identifying the impact of holidays, promotions, or external events requires additional contextual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior and business performance, I think it is necessary to integrate the \n",
    "provided data with additional data sources or to collect and analyze data specifically designed to answer these questions."
